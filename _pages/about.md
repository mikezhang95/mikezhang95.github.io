My name is Yuan Zhang. I am currently a PhD student at University of Freiburg, supervised by [Prof. Joschka Boedecker](https://nr.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/joschka-boedecker) and sponsored by the [ELO-X](https://elo-x.eu/) project. My research interest lies in applying reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to real-world applications, e.g. autonomous driving and robotics, which mainly touches the theoretical frameworks of robust RL and multi-agent RL.

Besides work, I am a sports person. I have played football and badminton since I was a kid and always enjoyed watched live games. I enjoy hiking in different places of the world (Mount Kilimanjaro, Poon Hill...). I also love to try new sports, e.g. fencing and surfing, to get fun from trial-and-error.
